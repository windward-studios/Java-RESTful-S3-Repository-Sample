You can find the documentation for the sample [here](https://engine-guide.windwardstudios.com/docs/Windward%20RESTful%20Engines/JavaRestSotragePluginSample).

Please note that this sample is not intended to be used in production. It is intended to be used as a reference for how to implement a storage plugin for the RESTful Engine.  Although it may work for you in certain use cases, this is not designed to be used at scale.  If you run into issues in larger scale environments, consult AWS documentation for best practices.
